# Symptom Analysis and Disease Prediction

***Exploring Various Machine Learning Algorithms to possibily predict the Disease of the Patient based on their Symptoms Reported.***

# DataSets

***Original Dataset for the Final Working set is sourced from another GitCommit. You can find them in Data Set (main) folder.***

***Also there are some other Data Sets that were used as References for this Project. You can find them in Data Set folder***

# Requierments for the Project

**Anaconda Suite**

***Download the Anaconda Distribution for your Working Platform (Windows / Linux / macOS) from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#Downloads)***

**Visual Studio / Studio Code**

***Alternatively, youcan use any other Code Editor - but make sure you have there belo lister Packages installed***

# Running the Project

***1. Open Anaconada Distribution and find Spyder IDE.***
***2. Load the MainCode.py and run through the Code for any errors***

# Note before Running : ***Both Data Set (Testing.csv and Training.csv) must be in same folder as the MainCode.py resides***

***3. Lookup for an Option saying "Run in New Kernel" and run the Code***
